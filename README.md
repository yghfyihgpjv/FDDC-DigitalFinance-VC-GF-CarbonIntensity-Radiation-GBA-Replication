# Replication Package README

This repository contains all replication materials for the paper  
*Asymmetric Digital Finance Exposure and Forecasting Energy Transitions in Polycentric Urban Systems: Beyond a Tale of Two Cores*.

Running the main script reproduces all empirical results reported in the manuscript and is intended to support the journal’s peer review and reproducibility assessment.

## 2. Data Description

### (1) Raw Data (`/data/rawdata/`)

All raw datasets (except literature and methodology documents) are provided in **Excel (.xls)** format for transparency and traceability.

* **DF data** (`df_index.xls`):
  Total digital finance index and sub-indicators (coverage breadth, usage depth, digitization level).
  Measurement logic and original data sources are documented in the accompanying DF methodology PDF.

* **GF data** (`gf_index.xls`):
  Core green finance indicators. Variable definitions and construction rules are documented in `gf_measurement_method.docx`.

* **VC data**:

  * `vc_micro_firm.xls`: Micro firm-level VC records (basic aggregation unit).
  * `vc_index.xls`: Prefecture-level VC panel aggregated from micro data, following the rules described in the manuscript.

### (2) Processed Data (`/data/processeddata/`)

* **29.dta** (Stata format, core operational file):
  The only dataset directly used in regression analysis. It integrates outcome variables, digital finance indicators, institutional variables (VC, GF), control variables, fixed-effect identifiers, and pre-constructed radiation weights.

* **processeddata.xls** (Excel format, auxiliary file):
  Provided for traceability only and not used in estimation.

## 3. Code Description

### (1) Main Script (`/analysis/code.do`)

This is the only script required to replicate all empirical results. It:

1. Loads `29.dta` using relative paths.
2. Generates descriptive statistics.
3. Estimates baseline fixed-effects regressions with clustered standard errors.
4. Conducts spatial heterogeneity and institutional mechanism analyses.
5. Performs robustness checks and counterfactual forecasting simulations.
6. Writes all outputs to `/results/a.txt`.

### (2) Weight Construction Script (`/analysis/wconstructingcode.do`)

This script documents the construction of directed radiation weights.
All weights are already embedded in `29.dta`.
The script is provided for transparency only and does not need to be executed.

---

## 4. How to Replicate

### Data Placement

Ensure that `29.dta` remains in `data/processeddata/`.
All scripts use relative paths; no files need to be moved.

### Execution

From the repository root directory, run in Stata:

```stata
do analysis/code.do
```

### Output

All results will be saved to:

```text
/results/a.txt
```

## 5. Software Requirements

* **Stata 15 or later** (tested on Stata 17)
* **Microsoft Excel / WPS** (optional, for viewing raw data)
* No additional user-written Stata packages are required.

---

## 6. Additional Notes

This replication package is provided for the journal’s peer review process.

* Publication metadata will be updated upon acceptance.
* A permanent access link will be provided for long-term reproducibility.
* Only `29.dta` is required to run the analysis; other files are for documentation.

**All scripts use relative paths. Please run the code from the repository root directory.**
